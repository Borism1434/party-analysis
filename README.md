# **2016 Florida Voter Registration by Race & Party Affiliation**

## **Overview**
This repository analyzes party affiliation shifts in Florida by comparing voter registration data from the end of the 2016 general election to early 2024. Using the state voter file, the project explores how voters across racial and age groups moved between the Democratic, Republican, and Independent parties over time. The analysis incorporates both raw counts and share-based metrics to assess the scale and direction of partisan shifts.

In 2016, Democrats held a narrow registration advantage of 338,889 largely due to strong support among Black voters. However, by 2024, Democrats experienced notable declines across all major racial groups—most significantly among Hispanic voters, where Democratic affiliation dropped by over 229,000. Simultaneously, the Republican Party maintained its dominance among White voters, who remain the largest and most GOP-aligned racial group in the state.

Party switch data reveals that Hispanic voters had the sharpest realignment, with a 10.5% net loss for Democrats and a 10.3% gain for Republicans. Black voters also showed a 6.4% Democratic net loss, though most shifted toward Independent status rather than directly to the GOP. Overall, 17.6% of all party switchers entered the Republican Party, signaling growing GOP appeal among disengaging or unaffiliated voters.

## **Understanding the 2016 Democratic Registration Edge**

## **2016 Voter Registration**
- Democratic registration advantage in 2016 relied heavily on Black voters, who made up 1,054,054 more Democrats than Hispanics, despite there being 302,144 more registered Hispanic voters overall. A closer look reveals that 650,825 Hispanic voters were registered as Independent, making up nearly the entire nonwhite Independent bloc. This positions Hispanic voters as a significant swing group with the potential to reshape electoral outcomes.
- The Republican Party’s largest and most reliable voter bloc in 2016 was White (Not Hispanic) voters, where they held a commanding registration advantage of 1,409,687 over Democrats—the only racial group where Democrats trailed significantly. While Democrats faced erosion among Hispanic voters, with 39.5% registering as Independents and only 35% as Democrats, Republicans maintained a stronghold among White voters, who registered 45.9% Republican compared to 28.9% Democrat and 26.7% Independent.

## **2024 Voter Registration**

- Despite an overall increase of 538,750 registered voters in Florida by early 2024, the Democratic Party experienced significant losses in affiliation across all major racial groups. Notably, there were 142,597 fewer Black voters registered as Democrats and 229,237 fewer Hispanic voters affiliated with the party compared to 2016. Native American voters shifted toward the Republican Party, resulting in a net Republican advantage of 3,579. While the decline in Democratic affiliation was observed across all racial categories, it was least pronounced among Black voters and most severe among Hispanic voters, signaling a substantial reshaping of Florida’s political landscape along racial lines.

- Hispanic voters demonstrated the sharpest partisan realignment, swinging substantially toward Republicans. With a 10.5% net loss for Democrats and a 10.3% net gain for Republicans, this shift—among a group representing over one-fifth of all switchers—underscores an alarming trend. In a state where Republicans already hold power at every level, this movement signals a deeper erosion that could reshape Florida’s political landscape for the next decade.
- Black (Not Hispanic) voters experienced a net loss of 6.4% for Democrats and a net gain of 8.0% toward Independent affiliation. This indicates a measurable shift away from the Democratic Party, primarily toward nonpartisan registration. Unlike Hispanic voters, where there was a notable movement toward the Republican Party, the shift among Black voters reflects increasing alignment with non-affiliated status rather than a direct partisan realignment.
- Overall, 17.6% of all party switchers shifted into the Republican Party, drawing from both former Democratic and Independent registrants.

- Republican net gains are strongest among mid-life voters, with a +6.5% shift in ages 35–49 and +7.1% in ages 50–64, suggesting the GOP is consolidating support from former Democrats and Independents, likely in response to political messaging resonating with this age group.



## **Conclusion**
This analysis provides a data-driven view of how party affiliation has shifted across race and age groups in Florida between 2016 and early 2024. The findings show meaningful realignments, especially among Hispanic and mid-life voters, alongside weakening Democratic affiliation across multiple racial groups. These shifts, though nuanced, may have long-term implications for party strategy, voter outreach, and electoral outcomes in a state already under firm Republican control.

Further analysis could incorporate county-level trends, turnout comparisons, or historical context to better understand what drives voter reaffiliation in Florida—and how these dynamics might shape elections in 2024 and beyond.
